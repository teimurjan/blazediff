## Interpretation

### Performance
- Hitchhiker's SSIM is **3.9x faster** than ssim.js (Weber)
- SSIM (Gaussian) is **3.2x faster** than ssim.js (Original)
- Average processing times: Hitchhiker's 7.6ms, SSIM 20.9ms
- Speedups calculated per-image, then averaged (more accurate than comparing average times)
- Uses integral images for O(1) window computation

### Accuracy
- **0.987 correlation** with MATLAB validates algorithmic correctness
- SSIM (Gaussian) achieves near-perfect **0.9999 correlation** with MATLAB
- Mean pooling aligns better with traditional SSIM than CoV pooling
- Edge case differences are systematic, not random

### Recommendations

**Use Hitchhiker's SSIM for:**
- Visual regression testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Large-scale image quality assessment
- Real-time similarity detection
- Applications where **3.9x speedup** over ssim.js (Weber) matters

**Use SSIM (Gaussian) for:**
- Cases requiring exact MATLAB compatibility (0.9999 correlation)
- Academic research requiring Gaussian weighting
- When 3.2x speedup over ssim.js (Original) is sufficient
