**BlazeDiff** â€” a high-performance diff ecosystem for JavaScript applications. Originally built as a pixel-perfect image comparison library that's 1.5x faster than [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch), BlazeDiff has evolved into a comprehensive suite of blazing-fast diff tools including image comparison, object diffing, perceptual quality metrics, web components, and React components for visualizing differences.

## Available Packages

### Core Libraries
- **[@blazediff/core](./packages/core#readme)** - Pixel-perfect image comparison (1.5x faster than pixelmatch)
- **[@blazediff/object](./packages/object#readme)** - High-performance object diffing with detailed change tracking
- **[@blazediff/ssim](./packages/ssim#readme)** - SSIM, MS-SSIM, and Hitchhiker's SSIM for perceptual quality assessment
- **[@blazediff/gmsd](./packages/gmsd#readme)** - Gradient Magnitude Similarity Deviation metric

### Command Line Tools
- **[@blazediff/bin](./packages/bin#readme)** - CLI with multiple algorithms (diff, GMSD, SSIM, MS-SSIM, Hitchhiker's SSIM)

### UI Components
- **[@blazediff/react](./packages/react#readme)** - React components for diff visualization
- **[@blazediff/ui](./packages/ui#readme)** - Framework-agnostic web components

## Quick Links

- **[Documentation](https://blazediff.dev/docs)** - Complete API reference and guides
- **[Examples](https://blazediff.dev/examples)** - Interactive demos and code samples
- **[Benchmarks](./BENCHMARKS.md)** - Performance comparisons and metrics

## Performance

BlazeDiff delivers significant performance improvements across all components:

- **Image Pixel-by-Pixel**: ~50% faster than pixelmatch (up to 88% on identical images)
- **SSIM**: ~25% faster than ssim.js, ~70% faster with Hitchhiker's SSIM
- **Object Diff**: ~55% faster than microdiff (up to 96% on identical arrays)
