**BlazeDiff** â€” a high-performance diff ecosystem for JavaScript applications. Originally built as a pixel-perfect image comparison library that's 1.5x faster than [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch), BlazeDiff has evolved into a comprehensive suite of blazing-fast diff tools including image comparison, object diffing, web components, and React components for visualizing differences. Designed for visual testing, CI/CD pipelines, data validation, and any application requiring fast, accurate comparison operations.

## Features

BlazeDiff provides a complete ecosystem of high-performance diff tools:

- **Image Diff**: Pixel-perfect image comparison with 1.5x performance improvement over pixelmatch
- **Object Diff**: Lightning-fast structural object comparison with detailed change tracking
- **Web Components**: Framework-agnostic components for displaying diffs in web applications
- **React Components**: Purpose-built React components for seamless diff visualization

## Image Diff

BlazeDiff's image comparison is **1.5x faster** than pixelmatch while maintaining identical accuracy and output quality. The performance improvement comes from:

- **Block-based algorithm**: Dynamic-sized blocks with processing only for changed areas
- **Early exit optimization**: Immediate return for identical images (Native C++ in Node)
- **32-bit integer comparisons**: CPU vectorization for faster pixel matching
- **Multiple format support**: PNG, JPEG, and WebP when using Sharp transformer

*100% API and Result Compatible: BlazeDiff is fully compatible with [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch)'s API and produces identical results when using the YIQ color space flag.*

## Object Diff

BlazeDiff's object comparison provides blazing-fast structural diffing with comprehensive change detection:

- **High-performance algorithm**: Optimized for speed with intelligent key lookup strategies
- **Detailed change tracking**: Precise path tracking for nested object modifications
- **Comprehensive type support**: Handles primitives, objects, arrays, dates, regex, and circular references
- **Memory efficient**: Minimal overhead with consistent object shapes for V8 optimization

**Difference Types:**
- `0` (CREATE) - Property or array element was added
- `1` (REMOVE) - Property or array element was deleted
- `2` (CHANGE) - Property or array element value was modified
